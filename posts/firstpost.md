### Hello! Let me introduce myself, my name is Brody.


Welcome to my blog about my experience with the coders guild where I will document each lesson with what we learned.

In this introductory lesson we met the founder of The Coders Guild Crispin. Crispin started the lesson by introducting himself and giving us an overview of the course, the outcomes of the course and what tools we will be using. He also gave us information on who to contact at The Coders Guild if we have any problems.


We then got started on creating a slack account and getting into the channel for our cohort where we can connect with each other on the course and share information about each lesson and just generally reach out to each other for help.  


We then has a brief introduction to the JAMStack, which is what we will be learning on this course. 

JAMStack stands for:  
  - Jamstack
  - APIs
  - Markup

The outcomes for this course are to build a portfolio to show to potential employers, personal branding and to earn a certificate of completion at the end. I am looking forward to the future lessons and seeing what I can take from this course!
