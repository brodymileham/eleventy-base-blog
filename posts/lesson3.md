### Frameworks

In this lesson, David introduced us to frameworks. We started off by learning what a framework is and the differences between a framework and a library. To put it simply, when you use a library you are in control of the flow of the application and when you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. Frameworks are pre-written coding solutions that make developing much faster, so the main reason for using a framework is for speed.

David then introduced us to [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) which is a CSS framework that allows us to quickly put together websites by using prebuilt components. Components can be anything from full navigation bars to a simple button all pre-built and have multiple styles to choose from. We learned how to install Bootstrap and add a component to the page before being tasked with building a semantic HTML page using bootstrap to advertise a made-up band. The webpage needed to include a carousel in the page hero, information about the band in the main section with an embedded youtube video and a sidebar with upcoming tour dates. Finally, a footer with a copyright symbol and the current year.

To summarize, by the end of this lesson we learned what a Framework was and the benefits to using one, and was able to put together a full webpage using Bootstrap.
