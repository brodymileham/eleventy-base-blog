### Accessibility and Semantic HTML

In this lesson we met another one of our teachers, Adam!

Adam started off this lesson by going through exactly what semantic HTML means on a webpage. Semantic HTML is where elements describe what they do in the tag name.     

Some examples of Semantic HTML tags:  
  - nav
  - header
  - main
  - footer
  - aside
  - section
  - article

We learned why using Semantic HTML really matters when building websites, and this is because it makes it easier for developers, screen readers and crawlers to distinguish between different types of content and data. It is also good for SEO (Search Engine Optimization). We also learned that they are 14.6 million disabled people in the UK and using semantic HTML can help these users navigate through your webpage using screen readers etc.

Our task for this lesson was to create a Semantic HTML table and style it with CSS.
