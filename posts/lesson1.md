### HTML and CSS Recap

In this lesson we met one of our teachers, David. David took us through a recap of HTML and CSS. We started off with a HTML and CSS Quiz to test our current knowledge and give us a refresher.

We then moved onto the differences between Inline Elements vs Block Elements. Block elements appear on the next line where inline elements will appear on the same line.

Some examples of inline elements include: img, a, br, em, strong, span.
Some examples of block elements inckude: p, h1, ul, li, and majority of other elements.

We then moved on to structuring content using div tags which is a block element that can wrap content on your site to divide it and apply styling using css. You can add a class or an ID attribute to a div to style it with CSS. 

After we talked about the div tag, we discussed the span tag which is an inline element that can be used to wrap small pieces of content. For one example, a single word in a sentence can be wrapped with the span tag and styled with CSS to change the colour of that word and not break the flow of the content.

Finally, we moved on to the box model. Basically everything in CSS has a box around it, and you can use the box model to position elements to create more complex layouts on your sites.    

The box model consists of:  
  - Content (the content inside the box)
  - Padding (the space between the border and the content)
  - Border (the edge around the border)
  - Margin (The space around the box that seperates it from other elements)

You can add a width and height to the box model to make it a size of your choice and use the properties above to place the box in your desired position.
